# Traffic Light Simulator

This is a simple traffic light simulator implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface.

## Overview

The Traffic Light Simulator allows you to configure the durations of the red, yellow, and green lights on a traffic light and then simulate the traffic light transitions based on those durations. It provides a graphical representation of a traffic light, and you can set the timers for each light's duration.

## Features

- Set custom durations for the red, yellow, and green lights.
- Simulate traffic light transitions with the configured durations.
- User-friendly GUI for easy interaction.
- Requires Transition timer to be set before start
- Provides Exit feature to ask user, "Are you sure you want to exit the application?"
